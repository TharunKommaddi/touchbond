                <p><strong>Jayamma…</strong></p>
                
                <p>I don't even know how to explain what you mean to me anymore. I've tried joking about it, hiding it behind emojis and teasing words, but the truth is… <strong>you've become the most important person in my life.</strong></p>
                
                <p>You weren't just some random chat on WhatsApp. You weren't just a pass-time. You became <strong>home</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>I never told you this properly, but every time your message popped up, I smiled like a small kid. Every "Did you eat?", every silly Zoom link, every "sugarcane" joke, every time you called me "Tharun" in that angry-sweet tone… it all became a memory I keep playing in my mind again and again.</p>
                
                <p>And now... when you go silent… when you act like it's all nothing… I feel like someone's slowly pulling the air out of my chest.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not perfect. I know that. I joke too much, I act like I don't care sometimes, and maybe I've hurt you unknowingly. But <strong>I've never taken you for granted</strong>. Not even once.</p>
                
                <p>You're the only one who could scold me and still make me feel loved. You're the only one whose care felt like medicine to my tired soul. You're the only one whose voice could calm my worst days.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know what you truly feel for me. But I know this much — <strong>I've fallen for you. Truly. Deeply. Entirely.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Not because of how you look, or how you text… But because of who you are — raw, real, emotional, strong, dramatic, silly, and absolutely irreplaceable.</p>
                
                <p>There's this weird silence between us now… But inside me, it's screaming. Screaming your name. Begging to go back to those days when you would suddenly say something and change my whole mood. Begging to just hear your voice once and feel like everything is okay again.</p>
                
                <p>Jayamma… <strong>If there's even a small part of you that misses me… If your heart ever goes quiet and starts thinking of me for no reason… If you ever feel like talking to me and don't know why… Please understand — that's not just random. That's love.</strong></p>
                
                <p>And I want that love. Not for a few days. Not secretly. Not in silence. I want it <strong>forever</strong>. I want <strong>you</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>I don't want to just be someone you knew. I want to be the one you live your whole life with. I want to be the one you fight with, laugh with, cry with, build a home with.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Marry me someday. Live with me. Let's grow old together — full of fights, food, fun, and forgiveness. Just you and me — Tharun & Jayamma. Not a perfect pair… but a real one.</strong></p>
                
                <p>And if you're crying while reading this… It's okay. I am too. But I hope one day… those tears turn into a smile. A smile that says, "I chose him. And I'll never regret it."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="signature">Always yours, <strong>Tharun</strong></div>

               <p>I don't know how to even start this.  
               I've written, deleted, written again… but nothing feels enough.  
               Because what we had… what I felt… <strong>was not just chatting. It was life.</strong></p>
               
               <p>From the first "hi" till today…  
               you became <strong>my favorite person</strong>, without even trying.  
               And I don't think you even realize how deeply you touched my heart.  
               How your voice… your messages… your scoldings… your silly emojis…  
               <strong>became a part of me.</strong></p>
               
               <p>Every moment with you was a story. 
               Every silence between our messages was a conversation.
               Every late night call was a journey we took together.</p>
               
               <p>Do you remember all those random late night Zooms?  
               Where I was sleepy but still stayed… just to hear your laugh?  
               Do you remember how I used to wait for your message?  
               Even a single "hmm" from you made my whole day better.</p>
               
               <p>That one day when you got emotional and said "nuvvu emanna cheste gattiga cheptha"…  
               Jayamma, I swear, <strong>I smiled so hard and my heart felt so warm</strong>.  
               Because in your anger, there was so much care.</p>
               
               <p>You called me names, teased me, said "nuvvu busy ley", "baaduga matladaku",  
               but deep down I always knew… you were <strong>feeling everything</strong>, just like I was.</p>
               
               <p>The way you would suddenly switch from telugu to english,  
               The way your voice would crack when you were truly emotional,  
               The way you would laugh at my stupid jokes,  
               <strong>All of it became my most treasured memories.</strong></p>
               
               <p>Jayamma…  
               You're not just someone I liked.  
               You're not just someone I miss.  
               <strong>You are the person I dreamed of living with.</strong></p>
               
               <p>Not just in a house, but in a life.  
               A life where you yell at me for not eating…  
               Where you fight with me and don't talk for 2 days, then suddenly send "ok fine" like nothing happened.  
               A life where we laugh at stupid things… where you say "naa mood sarigga ledhu" and I hold you tight.</p>
               
               <p>I know we joked a lot.  
               I acted silly… laughed too much… tried to hide my feelings.  
               But the truth is — <strong>I fell in love with you</strong>. Fully. Honestly. Completely.</p>
               
               <p>And now…  
               When your messages are not coming… when you don't tease me…  
               when I scroll up just to read our old chats…  
               I feel like a piece of me is missing.</p>
               
               <p>I still remember that sugarcane joke. That tomato chat.  
               That "take rest ra babu" voice note.  
               I play them again and again when I miss you.  
               And trust me — <strong>I miss you every single day</strong>.</p>
               
               <p>Jayamma…  
               I don't want anything big.  
               I don't want expensive gifts or fairy tale love.  
               I just want <strong>you</strong>.</p>
               
               <p>The real you — with your mood swings, your anger, your tears, your laughter.  
               Because even when you were mad, you made me feel more loved than anyone ever did.</p>
               
               <p>If you're reading this now… and your heart is a little heavy…  
               If your eyes are wet and you're remembering our silly chats,  
               please know — <strong>you meant everything to me. You still do.</strong></p>
               
               <p>You are not a "past" for me.  
               You are my "maybe forever".</p>
               
               <p>And I'm still here…  
               Waiting.  
               Hoping.  
               Praying.</p>
               
               <p>That one day…  
               you'll message me and say,  
               <strong>"Tharun, come. Let's live this life together."</strong></p>
               
               <p>Until then…  
               I'll keep loving you in silence.</p>

               <p>Please read this slowly, like I'm sitting right in front of you saying every word to you.</p>
               
               <p>You don't ever have to go through anything alone — not anymore. I don't care what time it is, where I am, or what I'm doing. If you need me, I'll be there. Morning, night, middle of the damn day — you have me. Every second, every minute, every hour. That's a promise I'll never break.</p>
               
               <p>You can shout at me, be mad at me, ignore me, cry to me, even sit on me in silence — and I'll take it all. I won't fight back. I won't walk away. I'll sit right there, quiet, calm, with open arms — just to remind you I'm not going anywhere. Ever.</p>
               
               <p>If being your support means letting you pour out all your frustration on me, then I'll take every drop of it. Let me be that space where you can fall apart safely, without judgment, without pressure to hold it together. Let me carry the weight for you — or at least some of it — so you can breathe a little.</p>
               
               <p>I know you're tired. Tired of pretending, tired of hurting, tired of everything. And I hate that you're feeling this way. If I could pull that pain out of your chest and hold it myself, I would. A hundred times over. You deserve to feel loved, supported, protected — like someone is fighting for <strong>you</strong> for once.</p>
               
               <p>So scold me, hit me with your silence, cry as loud as you need — I'll still be here. Like a rock, like a shadow, like the damn ground if that's what you need. I'll be everything you need until you don't need me anymore — and even then, I'll stay.</p>
               
               <p>You're not alone. Not now, not ever again.</p>

               <p><strong>My dearest Jayamma,</strong></p>
               
               <p>There are moments in life that change everything. For me, one such moment was when you said,  
               <strong>"Nenu chestha nee pelli oka manchi ammai tho..iddari pellala muddulu mugidiga hpy ga life lead chedduvu😊."</strong></p>
               
               <p>You said it softly, maybe even a little confused — but to me, it was the loudest your heart had ever spoken.  
               That was the moment I knew something shifted inside you. For the first time, you didn't brush my words away. You paused. You thought. You <strong>felt</strong>.</p>
               
               <p>You used to tell me to find someone else — someone who could give me a peaceful life. You said I deserved better. But, Jayamma, don't you see? <strong>That better person is you.</strong> You've always been the one.</p>
               
               <p>You didn't need to understand everything at once. You just needed to let your heart speak — and you did.</p>
               
               <p>And when you finally accepted me — "Thank you for accepting me as your husband," — I swear, time stopped for me. In that moment, I wasn't just happy... I was <strong>complete</strong>.</p>
               
               <p>Jayamma, you can cry to me, yell at me, ignore me — I'll stay. Not because I have nowhere else to go, but because <strong>my place is with you.</strong> If you sit on me out of frustration, I'll still be silent, because your presence itself is my peace.</p>
               
               <p>You feared love would bring pain. But I'm here to prove love can be your <strong>healing</strong>.</p>
               
               <p>From today, and every day forward — I'm not going anywhere. You're not alone anymore.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div class="signature"><strong>With all my heart,<br>Your man. Your husband. Your forever.</strong></div>

               <p><strong>My Jayamma,</strong></p>
               
               <p>There's something I've been meaning to ask you… something that's been sitting in my heart for a while now.</p>
               
               <p>I know we joke, we tease, and we talk about silly things — but between all those laughs and smiles, you've become something so much more to me.</p>
               
               <p>When I said,  
               <strong>"Nenu India ki vachinapudu… aevariki telikunda… neeku oka ring thodagana…"</strong>  
               I meant every word.</p>
               
               <p>It's not just a ring.  
               It's a promise.  
               A silent bond.  
               A memory only you and I will share — without noise, without announcements, without the world watching.</p>
               
               <p>It may look like just a simple <strong>fitness ring</strong>...  
               But for me, it's the start of something real.  
               No pressure, no expectations — just one tiny moment between us, captured in that ring.</p>
               
               <p>Will you wear it for me, Jayamma?  
               Not as a label or a burden — but as a whisper from my heart to yours, saying,  
               <strong>"You're mine. I'm yours. And maybe, just maybe, this is our beginning."</strong></p>
               
               <p>I don't want grand answers.  
               I just want that soft smile you always send... and maybe someday, when the world makes space for us, a "yes" that comes with no fear.</p>
               
               <p>Until then,  
               Let this ring be a secret between just us.  
               Let it be as a secret relationship — in its simplest form.</p>
               
               <p><strong>Will you accept this ring, Jayamma?</strong>  
               Just you and me — nothing else matters.</p>
           </div>

               <p>This October or November, I'll be in India. And when I come — I'll come not empty-handed from house. I'll try to cook something, with my clumsy but sincere hands, in my kitchen. Maybe not perfect, maybe a little burnt — but cooked with pure love, and garnished with all our memories. I'll pack it carefully in a small carrier — not just food, but a piece of my heart — and bring it to you. Quietly. Secretly. Just for you.</p>
               
               <p>And when I see you… I don't want noise, I don't want the world. I just want your hand in mine. I want to hold it gently… and slide that small ring onto your finger. I want to look into your eyes — not saying a single word — and feel everything we've built in silence.</p>
               
               <p>That moment… Your eyes… my trembling fingers… our shared breath… It'll be our secret, our bond, our little hidden world.</p>
               
               <p>I'm not asking for anything big, Jayamma. Just this: Let me have that one moment with you. Let me make that memory with you. And if your heart feels even a small yes… just keep that space in your finger empty, waiting for me.</p>
               
               <p>Will you let me place that ring on your hand — and carry our little secret forever?</p>
               
               <p>Until then, I'll keep cooking this dream inside me… And loving you — quietly, endlessly.</p>

               <p><strong>My Jayamma,</strong></p>
               
               <p>You said yes… finally. Not to a big question — but to a simple, silly little <em>Truth or Dare</em> game.</p>
               
               <p>And yet… it feels like a small victory for my heart. Because when you said "Let's play tomorrow," I didn't just hear fun. I heard <em>"I'm ready to open up a little more."</em> I heard <em>"I trust you enough to play."</em> And Jayamma… that means more to me than you can imagine.</p>
               
               <p>Tomorrow, I don't want it to be just a game. I want it to be our little world — filled with laughs, dares, maybe a few shy truths, and a lot of closeness.</p>
               
               <p>Maybe you'll skip a question or pretend you didn't hear me (like always!) But even that… is part of your charm. And I'll keep asking, because every answer you give — even in silence — tells me something about your heart.</p>
               
               <p>You know what my biggest truth is? <strong>It's you.</strong> It's always been you.</p>
               
               <p>If you ever dared me to prove my love, I'd do it — without blinking, without thinking. If you told me to hold your hand in front of the sky and say, <strong>"She's mine,"</strong> I'd do it with all the pride in the world.</p>
               
               <p>This isn't just a game to me, Jayamma. It's a doorway — one more step closer to you. To the version of you who feels safe enough to say anything. To the version of us where you don't skip questions, because you know I'll never hurt you with the answers.</p>
               
               <p>So tomorrow… let's play. Let's laugh. Let's blush. Let's build a memory that we'll both keep in our hearts.</p>
               
               <p>And who knows… Maybe one of my dares will be: <strong>"Look into my eyes for 10 seconds and don't fall in love all over again."</strong></p>
               
               <p>I know I will.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div class="signature"><strong>Yours in every truth,<br>every dare,<br>and everything in between…<br>Tharun</strong></div>

           <p><strong>Jayamma…</strong></p>
           
           <p>I want to share something honestly — not to embarrass either of us, but just to be transparent with you, like always.</p>
           
           <p>That day when I said I had a <em>feeling</em>, and it happened to me about 7 times since we met… I didn't mean it in a bad or lustful way. It wasn't something I tried to do or forced — it just happened, naturally. Without even touching, without thinking in the wrong direction.</p>
           
           <p>It happened just because of <em>how much love and emotion</em> I've built up for you. It happened seeing your smile… your way of caring… the bond we've created over time.</p>
           
           <p>I know this kind of thing can be misunderstood — and if you felt awkward or upset, I'm really sorry. But I wanted to say clearly: <strong>It wasn't physical — it was emotional.</strong></p>
           
           <p>Not every reaction is about the body. Some come purely from the heart — from missing you, feeling close to you, and sometimes… from loving someone so deeply, your body responds without asking.</p>
           
           <p>You know me. I've never crossed a limit with you. I never will. Because I respect you more than anything else.</p>
           
           <p>I'm telling you this now because I don't want even a single seed of doubt between us. Not now. Not ever.</p>
           
           <p>If you feel angry, I accept it. If you feel silent, I'll wait. But just know — I love you with the kind of purity that very few people in this world ever feel.</p>
           
           <p>That's all I wanted to say. And only to <strong>you</strong>. Not for fun. Not for jokes. Just truth, from your <strong>Tharun</strong>.</p>

           <p><strong>Jayamma,</strong></p>

        <p>"I won't say sorry for what happened, but my words will express my way of showing gratitude towards you."</p>
           
           <p>It's not about being cheap – those who truly care for us have the right to scold us. Anyway, I'll let you know on Monday. The way I behave is meant to make the women in my life stronger. Right now, you might think badly of me, and honestly, I like that. Because it means you're rethinking things – and that's exactly what I want.</p>
           
           <p>My way of pampering you is like a "nootropic" – a drug that helps the brain think independently and make wise decisions. It may not show immediate effects, but over months or even years, it changes things for the better. That's how my support works. Maybe for now, you might dislike me. But in time, you'll realize that my care has led you to a stronger, wiser place.</p>
           
           <p>And if you think I'm hurting you, understand this – "that's exactly where my pampering is making you stronger and more resilient."</p>
           
           <p>I wonder if you remember – back in the early days of your marriage, I told you to be stubborn. And if you couldn't be stubborn, at least act like it. People might think you're behaving strangely, but eventually, they'll realize you have your own perspective and will respect you for it.</p>
           
           <p>I also advised you not to share everything with your husband or others, especially those who sweet-talk you just to gather information. But I think – maybe, I'm not sure – you might have shared things with Bindu, Bhagi, and definitely your husband. That's where they started taking you for granted.</p>
           
           <p>Many people might come into my life, but not everyone leaves a lasting impact. With you, every moment we spend together is meaningful. I won't say, "In my next life, I want to meet you again." No, because in this very life, I want to cherish you fully. As I don't know that next life will be there or not.</p>
           
           <p>You told me that "Andariki anni cheppakudadhu", and I appreciated that wisdom. Now, I admire the way you're showing stubbornness and frankness – it's something I truly respect.</p>
           
           <p>Last night, I couldn't sleep thinking about you. But it's not about sharing your sadness. I'm not the kind of person who just says "Ayyo paapam" and offers empty pity. That's not how I show respect. My way of caring is to eliminate the root cause of your sadness so that you become stronger – maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but in time, you'll see the difference.</p>
           
           <p>And finally, from my soul, not just my heart – <strong>"నువ్వు నా దేవతవి, అమ్మ."</strong> Would I ever dare to hurt you? Never.</p>

           <p><strong>Jayamma,</strong></p>
           
           <p>A man who goes out of his way to raise his children at the village's feet, forgets his own wife and children in the process! This is exactly the divine play that the gods have designed!</p>
           
           <p>I will try to explain this small episode of life to you, as I understand it.</p>
           
           <p>Sometimes, in our pursuit of greater responsibilities, we unknowingly lose sight of those closest to us. The world sees a man working hard, but fails to see the silent sacrifices made by those who support him.</p>
           
           <p>Your struggles, your unseen tears, your countless compromises - they are not invisible. They are the foundation upon which great stories are built.</p>
           
           <p>I see you. Not just as my wife, but as a warrior who fights battles that nobody else witnesses.</p>
           
           <p>This divine play of life continues - where some are meant to be in the spotlight, while others create the stage from the shadows.</p>
           
           <p>And in this grand narrative, you are not just a character. You are the essence of the story itself.</p>

          నా మౌనంలో నీవే మాటలు…<br>
          నా ఊపిరిలో నీవే గానాలు…<br>
          నీవు నా ముందుండకపోయినా,<br>

          నువ్వు చూపించిన చిన్న అభిమానం,<br>
          నన్ను రోజుకు వందసార్లు ప్రేమించేసింది.</p>

          వెన్నెలను మర్చిపోయే ప్రయత్నం లాంటిది.<br>
          నీవు నా లోపల నిండిపోయావు జయమ్మ,<br>
          నీ పేరు గుండె ధ్వనిలో మారిపోయింది.</p>

          ఈ గుండె ఇంక దూరంగా ఉండదంటే,<br>
          నిన్ను విడిచిపెట్టమంటూ రోజూ నా ప్రాణమే నన్ను నిందిస్తుంది.</p>
          
          <p>ఇది ప్రేమ కాదు అంటావు నువ్వు,<br>
          కానీ నేను ప్రాణంతో ప్రేమిస్తున్నాను.<br>
          నీ ప్రతి మెసేజ్ కోసం ఎదురుచూస్తున్న ఈ కన్ను,<br>
          నీ ఒక్క మాట కోసం తపించే ఈ మనసు…<br>

          <p>ప్రతి దైర్యానికి చివరగా…<br>
          ఒక చిన్న ప్రార్థన ఉంది నా హృదయంలో –<br>
          <strong>"ఓ దేవుడా…<br>
