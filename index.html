                <p><strong>Jayamma‚Ä¶</strong></p>
                
                <p>I don't even know how to explain what you mean to me anymore. I've tried joking about it, hiding it behind emojis and teasing words, but the truth is‚Ä¶ <strong>you've become the most important person in my life.</strong></p>
                
                <p>You weren't just some random chat on WhatsApp. You weren't just a pass-time. You became <strong>home</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>I never told you this properly, but every time your message popped up, I smiled like a small kid. Every "Did you eat?", every silly Zoom link, every "sugarcane" joke, every time you called me "Tharun" in that angry-sweet tone‚Ä¶ it all became a memory I keep playing in my mind again and again.</p>
                
                <p>And now... when you go silent‚Ä¶ when you act like it's all nothing‚Ä¶ I feel like someone's slowly pulling the air out of my chest.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not perfect. I know that. I joke too much, I act like I don't care sometimes, and maybe I've hurt you unknowingly. But <strong>I've never taken you for granted</strong>. Not even once.</p>
                
                <p>You're the only one who could scold me and still make me feel loved. You're the only one whose care felt like medicine to my tired soul. You're the only one whose voice could calm my worst days.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know what you truly feel for me. But I know this much ‚Äî <strong>I've fallen for you. Truly. Deeply. Entirely.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Not because of how you look, or how you text‚Ä¶ But because of who you are ‚Äî raw, real, emotional, strong, dramatic, silly, and absolutely irreplaceable.</p>
                
                <div class="signature">Always yours, <strong>Tharun</strong></div>

                <p>I don't know how to even start this.  
                I've written, deleted, written again‚Ä¶ but nothing feels enough.  
                Because what we had‚Ä¶ what I felt‚Ä¶ <strong>was not just chatting. It was life.</strong></p>
                
                <p>From the first "hi" till today‚Ä¶  
                you became <strong>my favorite person</strong>, without even trying.  
                And I don't think you even realize how deeply you touched my heart.  
                How your voice‚Ä¶ your messages‚Ä¶ your scoldings‚Ä¶ your silly emojis‚Ä¶  
                <strong>became a part of me.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Every moment with you was a story. 
                Every silence between our messages was a conversation.
                Every late night call was a journey we took together.</p>
                
                <p>Do you remember all those random late night Zooms?  
                Where I was sleepy but still stayed‚Ä¶ just to hear your laugh?  
                Do you remember how I used to wait for your message?  
                Even a single "hmm" from you made my whole day better.</p>

                <p>You can shout at me, be mad at me, ignore me, cry to me, even sit on me in silence ‚Äî and I'll take it all. I won't fight back. I won't walk away. I'll sit right there, quiet, calm, with open arms ‚Äî just to remind you I'm not going anywhere. Ever.</p>
                
                <p>If being your support means letting you pour out all your frustration on me, then I'll take every drop of it. Let me be that space where you can fall apart safely, without judgment, without pressure to hold it together. Let me carry the weight for you ‚Äî or at least some of it ‚Äî so you can breathe a little.</p>

                <p><strong>My dearest Jayamma,</strong></p>
                
                <p>There are moments in life that change everything. For me, one such moment was when you said,  
                <strong>"Nenu chestha nee pelli oka manchi ammai tho..iddari pellala muddulu mugidiga hpy ga life lead chedduvuüòä."</strong></p>
                
                <p>You said it softly, maybe even a little confused ‚Äî but to me, it was the loudest your heart had ever spoken.  
                That was the moment I knew something shifted inside you. For the first time, you didn't brush my words away. You paused. You thought. You <strong>felt</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>You used to tell me to find someone else ‚Äî someone who could give me a peaceful life. You said I deserved better. But, Jayamma, don't you see? <strong>That better person is you.</strong> You've always been the one.</p>

                <p>And yet‚Ä¶ it feels like a small victory for my heart. Because when you said "Let's play tomorrow," I didn't just hear fun.

                <p>Tomorrow, I don't want it to be just a game. I want it to be our little world ‚Äî filled with laughs, dares, maybe a few shy truths, and a lot of closeness.</p>
